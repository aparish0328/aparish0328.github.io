                        <h2 id="about_me">I have been interested in video games and technology just about my entire life. My first memory with video games involves playing James Bond 007: NightFire; released in 2002. Ever since then, they have
                        remained an important aspect of my life. Over the years I have upgraded from console to console until I eventually built a gaming computer. I have not looked back since that decision. To be fair, my computer is probably a little overkill.
                        However, you can absolutely build a kick-ass computer on a budget.</h2>
