                            being used. It most also have enough SATA and NVME ports to support all of the connections needed for the system to work. WiFi chips are cool, but not necessary. A connection hub for Ethernet, audio jacks and USB ports is a necessity.
                            In this picture, the connection hub is located in the top left corner of the motherboard;the part with the cool-looking rainbow dragon.

                            processors come in different shapes and sizes. Generally, though, a processor with 8 cores and 16 threads with a relatively high base clock-speed (2.4ghz or higher) is desired for gaming. The processor is very important, but when it comes 
                            to video games, the Graphics Card will be doing all of the heavy lifting.

                            day-to-day web browsing. However, to play videos in high resolution and especially to play video games at any resolution; a graphics card is required. This is one of the most critical components of a gaming computer. To feed 
                            higher resolution monitors and to play modern games at high frame rates, beefier graphics cards are required.

                            for 600-1000 watts is ideal.

                            continue to store data until the data is either deleted or corrupted. SSDs are faster than Hard Disc Drives, but tend to have limited space and are more expensive.

                            Resolution is defined by the amount of pixels that a display can show horizontally as well as vertically. So, a resolution of 1920x1080 means that the display will show 1,920 pixels horizontally and 1,080 pixels vertically.

                            membrane. Membrane keyboards are most typical. They consist of a single membrane that does not have seperated keys, but rather pressure pads underneath each character key. A mechanical keyboard involves keys that are seperate from each 
                            other. Each key has a mechanical switch underneath it that produces the character upon activation.

                            as well as more than the typical amount of buttons will give the user an advantage. The mouse in this picture has several additional buttons that can be mapped to different functions within applications.
